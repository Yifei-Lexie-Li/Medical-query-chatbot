# ü§ñ Medical Query Chatbot - Enhancing Healthcare Assistance with AI  
**Code:** Medical Query Chatbot

This project leverages Hugging Face‚Äôs pre-trained transformer models to create a chatbot capable of handling medical-related queries. By fine-tuning the model on a domain-specific dataset and incorporating a retrieval-based approach, the chatbot is able to generate context-aware responses. The retrieval mechanism ensures that the most relevant information is pulled from an existing knowledge base, improving the quality of responses on topics such as symptoms, treatments, and medications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

- **Python**
- **Hugging Face**: For utilizing transformer-based models like GPT-2.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For training and fine-tuning the models.
- **Transformers**: For easy implementation of pre-trained models and fine-tuning.
- **BM25 or Dense Embeddings**: For retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

## üìà Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of medical dialogues, FAQs, and domain-specific medical information, which are tailored to healthcare-related queries.

## üí° Key Features

- **Model Selection and Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuned a pre-trained model on a medical-specific dataset to ensure accurate and relevant responses to healthcare queries.
- **Information Retrieval (RAG)**: Incorporated a retrieval-based approach (BM25 or Dense Embeddings) to fetch the most relevant information from the knowledge base, improving response relevance.
- **Multi-Turn Dialogue**: Designed the system to maintain context across multiple conversational turns, enabling coherent and meaningful interactions.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model‚Äôs performance through BLEU scores and user feedback, ensuring high-quality responses based on both retrieval and generation components.

- **Future Enhancements**: Error analysis and scalability plans for broader healthcare integration.
