# 🤖 Medical Query Chatbot - Enhancing Healthcare Assistance with AI
**Code:** Medical Query Chatbot

This project leverages Hugging Face’s pre-trained transformer models to create a chatbot that can handle medical-related queries. By fine-tuning the model on a domain-specific dataset, the chatbot is able to provide context-aware responses on topics such as symptoms, treatments, and medications.

## 🛠️ Tools

- **Python**
- **Hugging Face**: For utilizing transformer-based models like GPT-2.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For training and fine-tuning the models.
- **Transformers**: For easy implementation of pre-trained models and fine-tuning.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

## 📈 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of medical dialogues and FAQs, tailored to healthcare-related queries.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Model Selection and Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuned a pre-trained model for domain-specific medical knowledge, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.
- **Multi-Turn Dialogue**: Designed the system to maintain context across multiple conversational turns, providing more coherent and meaningful interactions.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using BLEU score and user feedback to ensure high-quality responses.
- **Future Enhancements**: Error analysis and scalability plans for broader healthcare integration.
