Medical Query Chatbot
This project implements a Medical Query Chatbot using Hugging Face's transformer models, fine-tuned to answer health-related queries. The chatbot provides users with accurate, context-aware responses regarding symptoms, treatments, medications, and more.

Model Implementation and Training
Model Selection: A pre-trained transformer model was selected for its ability to generate human-like responses.
Fine-Tuning: The model was fine-tuned on a medical-specific dataset using the Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 5e-5, and a batch size of 16 over 3 epochs.
Loss Function: Cross-entropy loss was used for response generation.
Metrics: BLEU score and user satisfaction score were used for evaluation.

Evaluation
The fine-tuned model significantly outperformed the base model in generating relevant and accurate responses for medical queries.

Sample dialogue:
User: "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"
Chatbot: "Common symptoms of diabetes include excessive thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss."

Future Enhancements
Error Analysis: Further dataset expansion and knowledge distillation techniques will be applied to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Scalability: Distributed training and deployment using tools like Docker will help scale the model for larger datasets.
